## 🧮 Modern Tkinter Calculator

> 📅 *Built as one of my first GUI projects in Python — exploring the basics of Tkinter and UI layout.*

---

## ✨ Overview

This is a simple yet visually appealing **GUI Calculator** built entirely using **Python’s Tkinter library**.  
It was one of my early coding experiments to understand how buttons, layouts, and event handling work in a desktop application — without using any external modules.
